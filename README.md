# Political Deception Classification: Dolos

A model trained to detect deception from political speech.

Specifically, I fine-tune a Roberta-like model to classify political speech as deceptive by utilizing a dataset labeled by politifact.com, which is available through huggingface [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liar). I'm hoping to see whether speech patterns or subject matter will be stronger signals on which to learn.
