A two part data science project involving lies told by politicians. We begin by looking for insightx that display the differences between the way that politicians speak when they are lying versus when they are telling the truth. We then train a model to detect misleading language from political figures.

We will utilize a dataset labeled by politifact.com, which is available through huggingface [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liar).
